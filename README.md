This website (in plain html) for recipes was basically a test, my goal was to learn version control with Git and Github by using shell (terminal) and plain vscode as my main text editor (besides some tinkering with nano). As part of the Odin Course curriculum my next step will involve CSS and maybe JS.
Thank you for reading.
